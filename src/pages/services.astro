          We are excited to offer a new training program designed to help organizations apply AI in development. This
          structured and clear approach will guide you through the process of integrating AI into your projects.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The training spans 3 weeks, with 3-4 workshops per week. You will learn how to apply AI in your projects and
          lead AI initiatives. The curriculum covers developing requirements, creating prototypes, producing design
          systems, structuring applications, writing code and tests, creating database models, and planning
          deployments—all with the help of AI.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Testimonial:</strong> "The AI training program was a game-changer for our team. We walked away with two
          critical skills that have transformed our workflow: AI-powered code generation, which cuts our development time
          by 30%, and intelligent debugging tools that help us catch and resolve issues much faster. It wasn't just training—it
          was a practical roadmap for integrating AI into our development process. We learned a lot while enjoying every
          moment." - Michael Harris, Product Owner at Stealth Startup
